(** Moving Average Helper Module

    The MA module contains the moving average functions. It calculates
    the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Simple Moving Average (SMA)
    to be used by the MACD and RSI modules*)

val smoothing : int
(** [smoothing] is the integer value 2; the commonly accepeted smoothing
    value in the finance industry *)

exception OutOfRange
(** exception [OutOfRange] is thrown when the [sublist] method attempts
    to access an element of a list that is out of bounds *)

val sublist : int -> int -> 'a list -> 'a list
(** [sublist start stop lst] takes in a list [lst] along with the
    [start] and [stop] index locations; returns the resulting sublist;
    method altered from {{:https://stackoverflow.com/a/2717815} here} *)

val avg : float list -> float
(** [avg lst] is the [float] average of a given [float list] *)

val sma : float list -> int -> float list
(** [sma lst n] is the simple moving average with groups of [n]
    consecutive days; it takes in a float list [lst] and returns the
    averages of [n] days as a float list *)

val ema_recurse : float list -> int -> float -> float list
(** [ema_recurse lst n yesterday] takes in a float list [lst] and
    applies a recursive function based on the interval [n] days and the
    EMA price of yesterday [yesterday]; formula for EMA can be found
    here {{:https://www.educba.com/exponential-moving-average-formula/}
    here}*)

val ema : float list -> int -> float list
(** [ema list n] applies the EMA function on a given data set; it skips
    the first value of the list as it does not have an EMA value for
    yesterday [yesterday], and applies the [ema_recurse] function for
    days after the first day; takes in a given time internal [n], which
    accounts for the specified time interval *)

val ema_today : float -> int -> float -> float
(** [ema_today price days yes_price] returns today's EMA value given the
    interval [days], today's price [price], and yesterday's price
    [yes_price] *)

val diff : float list -> float list
(** [diff lst] takes in a list [lst] of size [n] and returns the
    differences of each pair of elements, resulting in [n-1] elements *)

val gain_loss : float * float -> float list -> float * float
(** [gain_loss lst (gain, loss)] takes in list [lst]; for each element
    in [lst] it adds it to [gain] if it has a value >= 0.; otherwise it
    adds it to [loss] *)
