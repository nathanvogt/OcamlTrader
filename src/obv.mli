(** On Balance Volume Indicator

    The OBV module is the implementation of the technical indicator
    on-balance volume, which provides a running total of an asset's
    trading volume and indicates whether this volume is flowing in or
    out of a given security or currency pair. If OBV rises, this
    reflects positive volume pressure which can lead to higher prices.
    If OBV falls, then there is negative volume pressure which could
    lead to lower prices. The OBV is a cumulative total of volume
    (positive and negative). There are three rules implemented when
    calculating the OBV. They are:

    1. If today's closing price is higher than yesterday's closing
    price, then: Current OBV = Previous OBV + today's volume

    2. If today's closing price is lower than yesterday's closing price,
    then: Current OBV = Previous OBV - today's volume

    3. If today's closing price equals yesterday's closing price, then:
    Current OBV = Previous OBV; Source:

(** [update_val prev_obv prev_close vol close coin] takes in the
    previous OBV [prev_obv] as an [int], the previous close [prev_close]
    as a [float], today's volume [vol] as an [int], today's close price
    as a [float], and the coin name as a [string]; returns a tuple of
    today's close price [close] and today's OBV value [today_obv] in the
    form [(today_obv, close)] *)
