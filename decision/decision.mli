(** Helps main decide whether to buy or sell.

    Takes in the raw values of all the factors that are used to decide
    whether to buy, sell, or wait on a cryptocurrency. Interprets these
    raw values and maps them into the range [-50, 50] where the more
    negative the number, the stronger the suggestion to sell, and the
    more positive the number, the stronger the suggestion to buy. Also
    combines and normalizes these mapped indicators into a final
    decision. *)

val scale_values : (float * float) list -> float list -> float list
(** [scale_values wbs vs] scales each value in [vs] by the corresponding
    weight and bias in [wbs] *)

val interp_rsi : float -> float
(** [interp_rsi rsi] maps [rsi] to a buy/sell indicator where a very
    negative value suggests to sell and a very positive number suggests
    to buy. *)

val interp_macd : float -> float
(** [interp_macd macd] maps [macd] to a buy/sell indicator where a very
    negative value suggests to sell and a very positive number suggests
    to buy. *)

val interp_obv : float -> float
(** [interp_obv obv] maps [obv] to a buy/sell indicator where a very
    negative value suggests to sell and a very positive number suggests
    to buy. *)

val interp_so : float -> float
(** [interp_so so] maps [so] to a buy/sell indicator where a very
    negative value suggests to sell and a very positive number suggests
    to buy. *)
