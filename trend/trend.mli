(** Extracts possible trend lines from historical data

    Uses feeder to lookback at historical price data and identify
    possible horizontal trend lines. Trend lines can be used to predict
    price trends. *)

type crit_point
(** Representation of a critical point, identifying of a trendline *)

val crit_points_days : float list -> crit_point list
(** [crit_points_days l ] takes list of floats and returns the critical
    points that correspond to local minima and local maxima *)

val filter_crit_points : crit_point list -> float -> crit_point list
(** [filter_crit_points cps p] takes in a list of critical points [cps]
    and filters points clustered together with parameter [p]. Greater
    [p] is the more points filtered out. *)

val float_of_crit : crit_point -> float
(** [float_of_crit c] returns the float value of the critical point [c] *)

val trend_line_indicator : crit_point list -> float -> float
(** [trend_line_indicator cps p] takes in a list of critical points
    [cps] corresponding to horizontal trend lines and returns a float
    between 0 and 1 corresponding to sell and buy respectively at the
    current price [p]. long-term: combine trend lines so each line has a
    weight. Factor in the weight*)
